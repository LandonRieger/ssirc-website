    <h1>About SSiRC</h1>
    <p>
        SSiRC is an established SPARC (Stratosphere-Troposphere Processes and their role in Climate) activity, with SPARC being
        a core project within the World Climate Research Program (WCRP). SSiRC aims to foster collaboration across
        observational and modelling groups to better understand the stratospheric aerosol layer and the drivers for its
        observed variations. The abrupt volcanic enhancements of the stratospheric aerosol concentrations cause strong
        solar dimming and thereby surface cooling with important changes in circulation and atmospheric composition in
        response. SSiRC key science questions link with several foci of the WCRP grand challenges. The stratospheric
        aerosol layer was discovered 60 years ago, but it still poses us riddles. Aerosol above 15 km forms an optically
        thin veil with a small well characterized impact on climate, but then, in explosive episodes, it can intensify
        dramatically due to massive, aperiodic volcanic eruptions. Following such events, the stratospheric aerosol
        influences Earth's climate by cooling the planet as a whole and creates potentially devastating changes to regional
        weather patterns, such as winter warming in the Northern Hemisphere and reducing summer monsoon rainfall over
        Africa and Asia. It also increases the probability of an El Ni√±o in the following Northern Hemisphere winter.
        In the modern era, large volcanic events can temporarily slow the pace of anthropogenic global warming.</p>

    <h2>Open Questions</h2>
    <p>
        While much is
        understood about the impact of stratospheric aerosol on climate, there are a number of open questions relevant to
        SSiRC, SPARC and the WCRP:

                        What is the uncertainty associated with estimates of aerosol properties such as aerosol
                        optical depth over the satellite era, and what are the uncertainties at scales from the
                        1991 Pinatubo eruption to background levels?
                    </h5>
                    <p>Space-based measurements provide a record of microphysical and optical properties of
                        stratospheric aerosol with good time resolution and near global coverage. But significant
                        uncertainties as well as discrepancies between observations from different instruments
                        still exist and need to be understood. New satellite missions are urgently needed as the
                        future of space-based measurements beyond 2020 is uncertain.</p>

                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        About 50% of all aerosols contain non-sulfate cores of terrestrial or meteoritic origin,
                        and organic and nitrogen compounds contribute to the volatile fraction besides sulfate
                        particularly in the lower stratosphere. The contributions of different compounds from
                        different sources are not well quantified, and their role for the microphysical and
                        chemical aerosol properties is far from being understood and not yet accounted for in most
                        chemistry-climate models to date.

                        How do anthropogenic emissions stratospheric aerosol precursors affect stratospheric
                        aerosol variability?
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        There is significant uncertainty in the role of human-derived SO2 in changes to
                        stratospheric aerosol levels, and a potential contribution from emissions of other
                        precursors (organics, nitrogen compounds) has only recently been suggested. The impact of
                        regular minor volcanic injections of SO2 and ash into the lower stratosphere makes it
                        difficult to discern human and natural contributions. More measurements of SO2 and other
                        aerosol precursors in the tropical UTLS (Upper Troposphere/Lower Stratosphere) are needed
                        to quantify the role of human activity on stratospheric aerosol levels.

                    <h5>
                        How does the tropospheric sulfur cycle respond to climate change, and how does it affect
                        stratospheric aerosol levels?
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Natural processes play an important role in the global sulfur cycle. Different sulfur
                        compounds are emitted or taken up by vegetation, soils, the oceans and wildfires. Climate
                        change induces significant changes to and in many ecosystems and may thus alter natural
                        sulfur fluxes substantially. A quantitative understanding of these processes and fluxes is
                        necessary to predict such changes and possible climate feedbacks.

                    <p>
                        To investigate the impact of future changes in stratospheric aerosol on surface temperature
                        and precipitation, the temporal development of the stratospheric aerosol layer (including
                        sources and sinks) needs to be included as an interactive module in global climate models.
                        One particular focus is also on the impact of volcanic eruptions.

                    <h5>
                        How does co-emitted ultra-fine ash influence the volcanic SO2 radiative forcing from major
                        volcanic eruptions?
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Large amounts of ash are emitted by virtually all volcanic eruptions, but this ash is
                        usually removed from the atmosphere much more rapidly than the emitted SO2, and may
                        facilitate rapid removal of the SO2. However, the smallest ash particles may remain for an
                        extended period of time, and they may impact the microphysics and thus the lifetime and
                        radiative forcing of the sulfate particles.

                        What are the major uncertainties in calculating stratospheric aerosol radiative forcing?
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        For historic eruptions, knowledge of the initial vertical distribution of sulfuric source
                        gases, particularly SO2, is not well known nor is the impact of other condensable and
                        non-volatile material. As a result, the initial aerosol formation process and their
                        resultant radiative impact are difficult to model interactively or estimate from aerosol
                        observations. This data gap might be a potential source of the exaggerated heating found
                        in many models following the eruption of Pinatubo.

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
        By addressing these questions, SSiRC aims at better constraining the pathways of stratospheric aerosol and its
        precursors from emission to radiative forcing. By raising these questions and highlighting their importance,
        SSiRC stimulates research in this area, research that is relevant to WCRP's mission. SSiRC enables the
        assessment of our understanding the role of stratospheric aerosol in climate including the potential for
        catastrophic climate impacts following a major volcanic event, and decoupling more moderate climate changes in
        the stratospheric aerosol burden from those attributable to human activities. SSiRC builds a community from
        different fields of study and fosters collaboration. SSiRC connects to other WCRP/SPARC activities including
        ACAM, OCTV-UTLS and CCMI.
