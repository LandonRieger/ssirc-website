                "Space-based measurements provide a record of microphysical and optical properties of stratospheric aerosol with good time resolution and near global coverage. But significant uncertainties as well as discrepancies between observations from different instruments still exist and need to be understood. New satellite missions are urgently needed as the future of space-based measurements beyond 2020 is uncertain.",

The contributions of different compounds from different sources are not well quantified, and their role for the microphysical and chemical aerosol properties is far from being understood and not yet accounted for in most chemistry-climate models to date.",

The impact of regular minor volcanic injections of SO2 and ash into the lower stratosphere makes it difficult to discern human and natural contributions. More measurements of SO2 and other aerosol precursors in the tropical UTLS (Upper Troposphere/Lower Stratosphere) are needed to quantify the role of human activity on stratospheric aerosol levels.",

A quantitative understanding of these processes and fluxes is necessary to predict such changes and possible climate feedbacks.",

However, the smallest ash particles may remain for an extended period of time, and they may impact the microphysics and thus the lifetime and radiative forcing of the sulfate particles.",

As a result, the initial aerosol formation process and their resultant radiative impact are difficult to model interactively or estimate from aerosol observations. This data gap might be a potential source of the exaggerated heating found in many models following the eruption of Pinatubo.",

<h1 id="about-ssirc">About SSiRC</h1>
<p>
    SSiRC is an established SPARC (Stratosphere-Troposphere Processes and their role in Climate) activity, with SPARC
    being a core project within the World Climate Research Program (WCRP). SSiRC aims to foster collaboration across
    observational and modelling groups to better understand the stratospheric aerosol layer and the drivers for its
    observed variations. The abrupt volcanic enhancements of the stratospheric aerosol concentrations cause strong solar
    dimming and thereby surface cooling with important changes in circulation and atmospheric composition in response.
    SSiRC key science questions link with several foci of the WCRP grand challenges. The stratospheric aerosol layer was
    discovered 60 years ago, but it still poses us riddles. Aerosol above 15 km forms an optically thin veil with a
    small well characterized impact on climate, but then, in explosive episodes, it can intensify dramatically due to
    massive, aperiodic volcanic eruptions. Following such events, the stratospheric aerosol influences Earth's climate
    by cooling the planet as a whole and creates potentially devastating changes to regional weather patterns, such as
    winter warming in the Northern Hemisphere and reducing summer monsoon rainfall over Africa and Asia. It also
    increases the probability of an El Ni√±o in the following Northern Hemisphere winter. In the modern era, large
    volcanic events can temporarily slow the pace of anthropogenic global warming.

    While much is understood about the impact of stratospheric aerosol on climate, there are a number of open questions

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>
    By addressing these questions, SSiRC aims at better constraining the pathways of stratospheric aerosol and its
    precursors from emission to radiative forcing. By raising these questions and highlighting their importance, SSiRC
    stimulates research in this area, research that is relevant to WCRP's mission. SSiRC enables the assessment of our
    understanding the role of stratospheric aerosol in climate including the potential for catastrophic climate impacts
    following a major volcanic event, and decoupling more moderate climate changes in the stratospheric aerosol burden
    from those attributable to human activities. SSiRC builds a community from different fields of study and fosters
    collaboration. SSiRC connects to other WCRP/SPARC activities including ACAM, OCTV-UTLS and CCMI.
