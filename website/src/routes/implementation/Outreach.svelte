        The Stratospheric Aerosol Activity will continue to reach out to the broader scientific community. This includes
        improving connectivity with other APARC and WCRP activities such as the Atmospheric Composition and the Asian
        Monsoon (ACAM) activity, the Reanalysis Intercomparison Project (A-RIP), and the Observed Composition Trends and
        Variability in the Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere (OCTAV-UTLS) activity. The collaboration with the
        WCRP Lighthouse Activity on Climate Intervention Research in the context of SAI, a topic receiving increasing
        attention in the science community and potentially relevant to policy makers and society, has already been
        highlighted above. In the context of wildfires, we seek to strengthen connectivity to IGAC and in particular its <Link

        Dynamics, ) activity.

        After a major changeover in 2023, the activity’s Science Steering Group (SSG) is becoming increasingly diverse
        with participation of scientists from Europe, N. and S. America and Asia and a good representation of early
        career scientists, and we seek to further strengthen diversity in future. A good balance with participation from
        all continents is also reflected in the activity’s membership as reflected in our email distribution list and in
        attendance at workshops.

        Workshops and meetings are a key part of making the Stratospheric Aerosol Activity a unique community. We strive
        to continue to organize general and topical unique gatherings, where the state of art of stratospheric aerosol
        related science can be assessed. Efforts will be made to spread out more globally in terms of locations (like
        with the recent STIPMEX workshop in Pune, India), and also to accommodate hybrid participation and virtual
        workshops to provide participation and connectivity without the need for expensive travel. As in previous
        conferences (e.g. the Chapman conference in Tenerife, or the STIPMEX workshop), dedicated events and training
        schools for early career researchers will be an integral part of meetings organized by the Stratospheric Aerosol
        Activity.

        Outreach aspects are also being considered for the new Stratospheric Aerosol Activity’s website that will be
        launched later this year. An interactive overview table with direct links to observational data is being
        prepared in an effort to improve data accessibility and advertisement. There are also plans for the website to
        include informative and educational material on stratospheric aerosol science addressing both children and
        adults (e.g. inspired by NASA pages such as <Link
            href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/148276/smoke-in-the-stratosphere"
            >smoke in the stratosphere</Link
        >).
