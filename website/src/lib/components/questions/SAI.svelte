<Question {title}>
    <div>
        Calls to consider climate engineering (CI) as a means to mitigate climate change are growing louder, and SAI is
        nowadays openly discussed as one CI method. Much research has already been conducted over the past two decades,
        looking at potential benefits in terms of global radiative forcing but also at unwanted regional climate impacts
        as well as other risks such as chemical ozone destruction. As the community with comprehensive expertise on
        stratospheric aerosol, we naturally engage in this research striving to fill relevant knowledge gaps. We support
        ongoing and anticipated reviews and evaluations to provide a sound scientific foundation for scenario
        simulations in climate models and a comprehensive risk assessment of SAI. This will be done in close
        collaboration with the WCRP Lighthouse Activity on Climate Intervention Research (see below under Projects and
        Activities).
