        The importance of satellite observations with good spatial and temporal coverage can’t be stressed enough. Such
        observations are needed for climate models to simulate and predict regional climate impacts on seasonal to
        sub-seasonal time scales following episodic events like volcanic eruptions and wildfires, and they will be
        crucial to detect and monitor any deliberate SAI endeavors by governments or private stakeholders. Long-term
        measurements are critical to understanding a changing climate, but this area remains challenging as instruments
        are retired, updated and hopefully replaced. Ensuring continuity from an ever-changing collection of advancing
        instruments that span different techniques, sampling characteristics and quantities remains a primary challenge
        of the community that will be addressed by the Stratospheric Aerosol Activity with high priority. While
        discrepancies between instruments (e.g. reconciling solar occultation and limb sounding measurements under
        enhanced conditions) remains an ongoing source of consternation when merging records, the variety of current and
        planned missions, both in situ and remote, provide a unique opportunity for measurement synergy and aerosol
        understanding that was not possible in the past. The ability to improve detection, attribution and understanding
        of aerosol changes will rely both on the continuation of measurements and the community to maximize the science
        return from these records. Details on specific challenges and necessary tasks to be addressed in the context of
        stratospheric aerosol observations over the coming years are given in a white paper by an ISSI team on
        Perspectives of Stratospheric Aerosol Observations that was initiated by the Stratospheric Aerosol Activity.
