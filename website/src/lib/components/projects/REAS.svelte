            The REAS, Rapid Balloon Experiments for Sudden Aerosol Injection in the Stratosphere, {@html refs.cite(
                "dumelie2024",
            )}
            project is a collaboration between NASA, CNRS-Orleans and the University of Reims to launch instrumented balloons
            with aerosol measurements to respond to volcanic eruptions and PyroCbs impacting stratospheric aerosol. There
            are obvious links to the Stratospheric Aerosol Activity and in particular the VolRes project, and close links
            are currently being established. A dedicated project page on the Stratospheric Aerosol Activity’s website will
            provide relevant information including data links and promote this activity.
