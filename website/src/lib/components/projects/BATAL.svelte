            The Stratospheric Aerosol Activity will continue to collaborate with the Balloon Measurement Campaigns of
            the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (BATAL, Vernier et al., 2018). The project will be funded by NASA until
            2029, but campaigns may not take place every year. A regularly updated page about BATAL with links to latest
            results and data will soon be included on the Stratospheric Aerosol Activity’s website.
